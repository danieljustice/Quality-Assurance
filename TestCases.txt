PRECONDITIONS: The user has ran the program.
EXECUTION STEPS: 
  1. Enter the correct command line arguments for GoodOption, BadOption, Iterations, Threads.. Example: Goat Car 101 5
POSTCONDITIONS: The switch stay result has been displayed to the user.

IDENTIFIER: SwitchStay-Accurate-Iterations-Test
TEST CASE: Ensures that as many iterations are being completed as the user specifies
PRECONDITIONS: The user has ran the program.
EXECUTION STEPS:
  1. Enter the correct command line arguments for GoodOption, BadOption, Iterations, Threads.. Example: Goat Car 101 5
  2. The switch stay result has been displayed to the user.
POSTCONDITIONS: The user verifies that the iterations they entered equal the displayed iterations.

IDENTIFIER: Thread-Off-By-One-Test
TEST CASE: Ensures that threading is implemented correctly and that one thread is not bearing all the weight.
PRECONDITIONS: The user has ran the program.
EXECUTION STEPS:
  1. Enter the correct command line arguments for GoodOption, BadOption, Iterations, Threads.. Example: Goat Car 101 5
  2. The thread number and iterations per thread are displayed to the user.
POSTCONDITIONS: The user verifies that the iterations per thread is never off by more than one in comparison to other threads.

IDENTIFIER: Thread-Display-Test
TEST CASE: Ensures that there are as many threads as the user specifies.
PRECONDITIONS: The user has ran the program.
EXECUTION STEPS:
  1. Enter the correct command line arguments for GoodOption, BadOption, Iterations, Threads.. Example: Goat Car 101 5
POSTCONDITIONS: The user verifies that the iterations per thread is displayed for the correct thread count.

IDENTIFIER: Output-Has-Three-Decimals-Test
TEST CASE: Test to make sure outputs always have three decimal places of precision.  No more, no less.
PRECONDITIONS: The user has ran the program.
EXECUTION STEPS:
  1. Enter the correct command line arguments for GoodOption, BadOption, Iterations, Threads.. Example: Goat Car 101 5
POSTCONDITIONS: The user verifies that the output display is rounded up to three decimal places.

IDENTIFIER:	Argument-Display-Test
TEST CASE: Ensures that the strings inputed for "Good" and "Bad" arguments are properly displayed.
PRECONDITIONS: The user has ran the program.
EXECUTION STEPS:
    1. Enter the correct command line arguments for GoodOption, BadOption, Iterations, Threads.. Example: Goat Car 101 5
POSTCONDITIONS: The user verifies that the output display contains the two passed in string versions of "Good" and "Bad". In the example input, this would result in Goat, and Car being displayed.

IDENTIFIER:	Missing-Args-Test
TEST CASE: Tests that if there are missing arguments then the program will prompt the user to input the correct arguments and then 
           gracefully terminate.
PRECONDITIONS: The user has ran the program.
EXECUTION STEPS: The user inputs an invalid number of arguments for the program that are less than four.
                  - Examples include, 3,2,1, and 0.
POSTCONDITIONS: The system will display the useage information for the program and shut down.

IDENTIFIER:	Extra-Args-Test
TEST CASE: Tests that if there are extra arguments then the program will prompt the user to input the correct arguments and then 
           gracefully terminate.
PRECONDITIONS: The user has ran the program.
EXECUTION STEPS: The user inputs an invalid number of arguments for the program that are greater than four.
                  - Examples include, 5,6,500.
POSTCONDITIONS: The system will display the useage information for the program and shut down.

IDENTIFIER: Small-Nums-Test
TEST CASE: Ensures that the program properly prompts the user if the number of iterations is 100 or less.
PRECONDITIONS: The user has ran the program.
EXECUTION STEPS:
  1. The user inputs an "iterations" argument less than 100.
  2. The rest of the input for the program arrguments will be correct.
POSTCONDITIONS: The program shall issue a warning and ask the user if they wish to continue.

IDENTIFIER: Small-Num-Cont-Invalid-Input-Test
TEST CASE: Tests the small numbers warning prompt can handle invalid inputs whithout crashing.
PRECONDITIONS: The user has ran the program.
EXECUTION STEPS:
  1. Enter the correct command line arguments for GoodOption, BadOption, Threads, and enter in
     an iteration count of 100 or less. Example: Goat Car 98 5
  2. The user is prompted for "Y" or "N" input for continuing with less than 100 iterations.
  3. The user inputs invalid data for this option.
POSTCONDITIONS: Upon each invalid input, the program continues to ask the user for "Y" or "N" arguments.

IDENTIFIER: Small-Num-Cont-Valid-Input-Test
TEST CASE: Tests that the small numbers warning prompt handles each valid input appropriately.
PRECONDITIONS: The user has ran the program.
EXECUTION STEPS:
  1. Enter the correct command line arguments for GoodOption, BadOption, Threads, and enter in
     an iteration count of 100 or less. Example: Goat Car 98 5
  2. The user is prompted for "Y" or "N" input for continuing with less than 100 iterations.
  3. The user inputs "Y","N","y",or "n" for this option. 
POSTCONDITIONS: 
  1. If the user selects "Y" or "y", the program will continue to execute.
  2. If the user selects "N" or "n", the program will exit.
