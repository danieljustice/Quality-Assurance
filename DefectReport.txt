 SUMMARY: Program exits with a stack trace when invalid args are passed into Thread argument.
 DESCRIPTION: When a non-numerical argument is passed into the Threads argument the program breaks and exits with a stack trace. Per the                 requirements the program should notify the user of the invalid argument and then exit gracefully.

          2) Program will exit with a stack trace
 EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:The program will prompt the user that an invalid argument was inputed and then gracefully exit.
